This repository contains my data analysis of the Vancouver Trees data set from the __"datateachr"__ package for STAT 545A. This analysis involves table manipulation using the tidyverse package and plotting using the ggplot2 package. There are 3 milestones in this repository


The source .rmd and the knit .md files along with the respective output folders (containing the plots as .png files) can be found in their respective folders at the top level of this repository. 

The saved data files from milestone 3 can be found in the __"output"__" folder under their respective milestone folders.
